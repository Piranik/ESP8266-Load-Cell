# ESP8266 Load Cell
A MQTT client to read out the result of HX711 and send it to a MQTT Broker.

#### This is a (somewhat) fork of [newAM/LoadCellOccupany](https://github.com/newAM/LoadCellOccupany/). Be sure to check his repository out!

## Hardware

This is the exact Hardware I'm using. It cost around 5-10â‚¬ on AliExpress.
- ESP8266 - [WeMos D1 mini Pro](https://wiki.wemos.cc/products:d1:d1_mini_pro)
- ADC - HX711
- Load Cell - Search for "50kg load cell hx711" on AliExpress. It'll have a HX711 included.
- 3D printed case for the load cell.
